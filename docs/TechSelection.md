#### List of technology used:
##### Backend:
| Technology  | Descriptions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MySQL  | MySQL is still the most popular and commonly used RDBMS. Web-sites and web-applications can simply work on MySQL despite some constraints. This flexible and somewhat scalable tool is easy to use and easy to manage.  |
| Express JS  | Express.js is a web framework for node. It is also required for this project.  |
| Node Js | Node.js is an event-driven I/O server-side JavaScript environment.  It is required for this project. |
| Socket io | Socket.io is a JavaScript-based middleware for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. We need socket.io implement real-time private/public chat. |
| Mocha, Sinon, Chai | Mocha is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser which also has capability to do asynchronous testing fairly easy. Chai is assertion library for Node.js and can be easily paired with Mocha. Sinon.js is standalone test spies, stubs, and mocks for JavaScript. |

##### Frontend
| Technology  | Descriptions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HTML | HTML which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is used to deliver content in the form on web-pages. Browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. receive HTML documents from a Web Server or a local host, and then render the web page. HTML can be combined with other web technologies like JavaScript and CSS to deliver rich content. Due to the inherent inseparability of HTML from the WWW fabric, we have chosen to use this technology. |
| Javascript | JavaScript is a high level interpreted language which runs in all modern browsers. With HTML and CSS, it forms the core of the World Wide Web. JavaScript by itself doesn’t support any I/O operations, and has to be supported by other technologies. It can run directly on the client side in the web browser, and on the server side through environments such as Node.js which allow the server to provide non-blocking I/O services. JavaScript allows web-pages to become more dynamic and responsive to the user. The wide support for JavaScript and the necessity of creating a uniform platform throughout the application has led us to choose JavaScript for the client side scripting. |
| CSS | Cascading Style Sheets is used to separate content delivery and its presentation. Using CSS, it is possible to provide visually engaging experiences to the user. CSS in combination of other technologies, like Bootstrap, provides an immersive interface, and hence, we choose this technology for styling the HTML rendered web-pages. |
| JQuery | jQuery is a library for JavaScript which makes manipulation of HTML document easy. It is also useful for animating web pages and running Ajax queries and scripts.  As it is a library, it works across multiple browsers which support JavaScript. We will use jQuery to extend the functionality of JavaScript using the API provided by the package. |
| Bootstrap | Bootstrap provides a set of front-tier development frameworks. It will facilitate our client side development(faster and easier) by using Bootstrap |
| Selenium IDE | It is useful for our web application tests such user interface automation test |

##### Others
| Technology  | Descriptions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| StarUML | A software’s architectural details can be captured accurately using UML diagrams. StarUML is a UML tool provided by MKLab, which can adequately model the features of the software project that has to be implemented during this course. |
| Sublime Text | Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python API. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. |
| Swagger.io | We use it to represent the REST API of our web app |
| Circle CI | Continuous Integration tool will help us integrating the code and running some verification by using automated build that enables the developer team to detect and solve problem early. For this project, we choose Circle CI as the continuous integration tools. The benefits of the tools are: Simple setup and Support backend and frontend deployment. |
